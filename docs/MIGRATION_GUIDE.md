### Manual Backup

#### Windows

```powershell
# Find your data directory
cd %APPDATA%\program-planner

# Create backup
xcopy data data-backup-%date:~-4,4%%date:~-10,2%%date:~-7,2% /E /I
```

**Default location:**
```
C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Roaming\program-planner\data\
```

#### macOS

```bash
# Find your data directory
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/program-planner

# Create backup
cp -r data data-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

**Default location:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/program-planner/data/
```

#### Linux

```bash
# Find your data directory
cd ~/.config/program-planner

# Create backup
cp -r data data-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

**Default location:**
```
~/.config/program-planner/data/
```

### What to Backup

These files contain all your data:

4. Clear application cache
5. Reinstall if needed

### Slow Performance

**Symptom:** Application feels slow

**Solution:**
1. Close and restart application
2. Check system resources
3. Clear browser cache
4. Reduce number of visible tasks (use filters)
