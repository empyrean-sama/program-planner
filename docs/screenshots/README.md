## How to Add Screenshots

1. **Take screenshots** as described above
2. **Save them** in this directory (`docs/screenshots/`)
3. **Use exact filenames** listed above:
   - `home-dashboard.png`
   - `calendar-view.png`
   - `task-management.png`
   - `task-details.png`
   - `metrics.png`

4. **Optimize images** (optional but recommended):
   - Use PNG format for clarity
   - Compress if file size > 500KB
   - Ensure text is readable
   - Use consistent window size

## Screenshot Tips

- **Use a clean state**: Remove test data or use realistic example data
- **Consistent theme**: Use the same theme (light/dark) for all screenshots
- **Full window**: Capture the entire application window including title bar
- **High DPI**: Use 1.5x or 2x DPI scaling for crisp images
- **Annotate if needed**: You can add arrows or highlights to draw attention

## Placeholder Images

If you don't have screenshots ready yet, the README will work fine - it just won't display images. The placeholder image paths are already set up and will automatically work once you add the images to this directory.

## Example Screenshot Naming

✅ **Correct:**
```
docs/screenshots/home-dashboard.png
docs/screenshots/calendar-view.png
docs/screenshots/task-management.png
docs/screenshots/task-details.png
docs/screenshots/metrics.png
```

❌ **Incorrect:**
```
screenshots/home.png
docs/home-dashboard.jpg
images/calendar.png
```

---

**Note:** The README markdown already references these images with the correct paths. Once you add the images here, they will automatically display in the README.
